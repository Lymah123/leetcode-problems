# 68. Text Justification
# Difficulty level: Hard
# Top Interview 150
# Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

# You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

# Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the extra spaces on the left will be assigned more spaces than the right.

# For the last line of text, it should be left justified and non extra space is inserted between words.

# Note:
# - A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
# - Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
# - The input array words contains at least one word.

# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
# Output:
# ["This    is    an",
# "example  of text",
# "justification.  "]
# Explanation: Each line has exactly 16 characters.
# Extra spaces between words are distributed as evenly as possible, with the extra spaces on the left side.
# Note that the last line is not fully justified, as it only contains the left justified words.

# Example 2:
# Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
# Output:
# ["What   must   be",
# "acknowledgment  ",
# "shall be        "]
# Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall  be ", because the last line should be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
# Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.

# Example 3:
# Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
# Output:
# ["Science  is  what we",
# "understand      well",
# "enough to explain to",
# "a  computer.  Art is",
# "everything  else  we",
# "do                  "]
# Explanation: Note that the last line is "do                  ", where there are 10 spaces after the word "do".

# Constraints:
# 1 <= words.length <= 300
# 0 <= words[i].length <= 100
# words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
# 1 <= maxWidth <= 100
# maxWidth is at least the length of the longest word in words.
# The input array words contains at least one word.
# The words in words are separated by a single space.
# Solution to the question

                    cur[i % (len(cur) - 1 or 1)] += ' '

# The output is formatted with double quotes to show the exact spacing.
# The function `fullJustify` takes a list of words and a maximum width and returns a list of strings, each string being a line of justified text.
# The function uses a greedy approach to pack as many words as possible into each line, ensuring that the lines are fully justified according to the specified rules.
# The last line is left-justified and does not require extra spaces between words.
# The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the justified lines.
# The output is formatted with double quotes to show the exact spacing.
# The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of words in the input list. This is because we iterate through each word once and perform constant-time operations for each word.
# The space complexity is O(n) as well, since we store the justified lines in a list and the maximum number of lines we can have is equal to the number of words.
# The space complexity is also affected by the storage of the current line of words, which can also be at most n in size.
# The function handles edge cases such as:
# - When the input list contains only one word.
# - When all words fit in a single line.
# - When the maximum width is equal to the length of the longest word.
# - When there are multiple spaces between words.
# The function is designed to work efficiently within the constraints provided in the problem statement.
# The function is also designed to handle various edge cases, such as:
